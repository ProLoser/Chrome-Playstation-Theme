# Chrome-Playstation-Theme
In cellebration of PlayStation 5, I'm releasing this unofficial theme I developed while working at Sony to help identify my work browser from my personal one :D

# Installation
0. Clone / download and unzip repo
1. Go to the Google Chrome Extensions page
2. Check the 'Developer Mode' box
3. Click on 'Load Unpacked Extension'
4. Select the theme folder

# Customization
[Official Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/themes)
[Reference API](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/browser/themes/browser_theme_pack.cc;l=218-247?q=file:chrome%2Fbrowser%2Fthemes%20symbol:kTintTable$&ss=chromium&originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2Fsearch%2F)

Feel free to play with the `manifest.json` to tweak the theme as you see fit. I'm not 100% sure what all the fields do.

## Notes:
- `ntp` stands for `New Tab Page`, which is the screen you're greeted with when you open a new page.
- `inactive` means when the window is not in focus
