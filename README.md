# Customization
[Official Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/themes)

Feel free to play with the `manifest.json` to tweak the theme as you see fit. I'm not 100% sure what all the fields do.

One thing to note is that `ntp` stands for `New Tab Page`, which is the screen you're greeted with when you open a new page.
It's a little annoying customizing the manifest because the documentation around it is sparse and possibly out of date.
